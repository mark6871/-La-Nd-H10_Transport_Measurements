# LaNdH10_Transport_Measurements

The results of transport measurements in steady and pulsed magnetic fields (run 1, run 2) for DAC E0 (180 GPa) and DAC E1 (170 GPa, in different degrees of sample degradation) are presented. Some raw data is > 180 Mb and cannot be uploaded to github. Access to them is available on request.
